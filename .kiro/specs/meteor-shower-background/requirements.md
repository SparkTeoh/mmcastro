# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add an animated meteor shower background effect to the team page. The effect will consist of animated streaks of light that fall diagonally across the screen, creating a dynamic and visually appealing background that enhances the team page's visual impact without interfering with content readability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see an engaging meteor shower animation on the team page background, so that the page feels more dynamic and visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the team page loads THEN the system SHALL display animated meteor streaks falling diagonally across the background
2. WHEN meteors reach the bottom of the screen THEN the system SHALL regenerate them at the top to create a continuous effect
3. WHEN the animation is running THEN the system SHALL ensure meteors have varying sizes, speeds, and opacity levels for visual variety
4. WHEN the page is viewed THEN the system SHALL ensure the meteor effect does not interfere with text readability or user interaction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the meteor shower effect to be performant and responsive, so that it doesn't slow down the page or cause issues on different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the meteor animation runs THEN the system SHALL use CSS transforms and GPU acceleration for smooth performance
2. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL either disable the effect or use a lighter version to maintain performance
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL ensure the meteor effect doesn't block or delay the loading of main content
4. WHEN multiple meteors are animated THEN the system SHALL limit the number of concurrent animations to maintain 60fps performance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the meteor shower effect to be visually cohesive with the existing design, so that it feels integrated rather than distracting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN meteors are displayed THEN the system SHALL use colors that complement the existing color scheme (gold/primary colors)
2. WHEN the effect is active THEN the system SHALL ensure meteors have a subtle glow effect that matches the brand aesthetic
3. WHEN viewed against the background THEN the system SHALL ensure meteors have appropriate opacity to not overpower the content
4. WHEN the animation runs THEN the system SHALL position meteors behind all content elements using appropriate z-index values

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the meteor shower effect to be easily configurable and maintainable, so that it can be adjusted or disabled if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the effect THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options for meteor count, speed, and size
2. WHEN the effect needs to be disabled THEN the system SHALL allow easy toggling via CSS class or JavaScript flag
3. WHEN customizing the effect THEN the system SHALL use CSS custom properties for easy theme adjustments
4. WHEN maintaining the code THEN the system SHALL implement the effect as a reusable component that can be applied to other pages if needed
